      <h2>LaunchCode Came up During A Friendly Conversation</h2>

      <p>My journey into coding began with a friendly conversation with the father of one of my clients. We were discussing 
     lucrative skill trades and he mentioned that coding was an underrated, high-demand, craft that offerred a variety of 
     profitable career opportunities. I had previously heard the term "coding" in several cheesy YouTube ads, but I hadn't 
     taken it seriously until he shared with me that he earned over $70K his first year of working for a tech company developing 
     geospatial websites for farmers. I congratulated him for being the stereotypical computer nerd, who earns high-income and marries 
     a woman who looks better than him, but I also explained that I kwew diddly-squat about computers and that the Department of 
     Education was already bullying my pockets and I couldn't afford to go back to college. He laughed, and then told me the 
     organization where he works frequently hires apprentices from a free, non-profit, technology training program called LaunchCode.</p>

      <h2>LaunchCode's Enrollment Process </h2>

      <p>The next day, I walked into the LaunchCode headquarters and spoke with the director and several LaunchCode workers to gain insight
     about the type of training they offered and about the enrollment requirements. To my delight, I didn't need any computer 
     programming experience to enroll, all I needed was a basic laptop, and if I didn't have one, LaunchCode issued laptops for 
     students to complete the course at no additional cost. I didn't have to worry about the courses conflicting with my current work 
     schedule, because LaunchCode offered a free, part-time web development course that met twice a week after 5PM. The timing couldn't 
     had been more perfect, applying for enrollment online was easy, and in a few weeks, I was accepted and enrolled into LaunchCode's Web 
     Development course.</p>

      <h2>LaunchCode Has A Diverse Network Of Coders</h2>

   <p>Since starting at LaunchCode, not only have I learned the basic computer skills related to creating and fixing code in JavaScript, 
     but equally as important, I've also learned the value of establishing computer programming networks with peers. LaunchCode has a 
     diverse student population that consist of various races and cultures who have an assortment of computer programming skills. For 
     example, some students, such as myself, came into the program with little to no coding experience, while others might have taken
     coding courses before or have relatives who work for cyber security. The class structure at LaunchCode is mixed in such a 
     way at if a student struggles to understand a code method or concept, not only can he or she get assistance from a TA, but the 
     student can also interact with colleagues who have slightly more coding experience to figure out solutions. There's a sense of 
     camaraderie When I look to my left or right and notice someone encountering the same complication I'm having, because it shows 
     me that I'm not going through it alone, and if need be, there's a network of knowledgable peers to reach out to for help in 
     overcoming that obstacle. If you're reading this, that means I have successfully developed and published my first webpage with 
     the training offered by LaunchCode. This webpage is a testament that you don't need any prior experience in computer programming 
     to become a coder. If you have the will, there's a way.</p>
