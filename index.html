      <h2>LaunchCode Came up During A Friendly Conversation</h2>

      <p>My journey into coding began with a friendly conversation with the father of one of my clients. We were 
     discussing 
     lucrative skill trades and he mentioned something about coding being an underrated, high-demand skill that offerred a variety of 
     profitable career opportunities. I had previously heard the term "coding" in several cheesy YouTube ads, but I hadn't 
     taken it seriously until he shared with me that he earned over $70K his first year of working for a tech company developing 
     geospatial websites for farmers. I congratulated him for being the stereotypical computer nerd, like the scoially awkward movie  
     character who eventually earns a lot of money and ends up marrying a woman who's far better looking than him. We shared a laugh, and 
     then I went on to explain that I kwew diddly-squat about computers and that the Department of Education was already bullying my 
     pockets, so I couldn't afford to go back to college. He chunckled, and then told me the organization 
     where he works frequently hires apprentices from a free, non-profit, technology training program called LaunchCode.</p>

      <h2>LaunchCode's Enrollment Process </h2>

         class="funParagraph">The next day, I walked into the LaunchCode headquarters and spoke with the director and several LaunchCode 
      workers to get information about the training they offered and the enrollment requirements. To my delight, I didn't need any computer 
      programming experience to enroll, all I needed was a basic laptop, and if I didn't have one, LaunchCode issued laptops to students to 
      complete the course at no additional cost. More over from that, I didn't have to worry about the courses conflicting with my current 
      work schedule, because LaunchCode offered a free, part-time web development course that met twice a week after 5PM. The timing couldn't 
      had been more perfect. Applying for enrollment online was easy, and in a few weeks, I was accepted and enrolled in LaunchCode's free 
      Web Development course.</p>

      <h2>LaunchCode Has A Diverse Network Of Coders</h2>

   <p>Since starting at LaunchCode, not only have I learned the basic computer skills related to writing and repairing code in JavaScript, 
     but equally as important, I've also learned the value of establishing computer programming networks with peers. LaunchCode has a 
     diverse student population that consist of various races and cultures who have an assortment of computer programming skills. For 
     example, some students, such as myself, came into the program with little to no coding experience, while others had previously 
     taken coding courses before, or have relatives who work for cyber security. The class structure at LaunchCode is mixed in such a 
     way that if a student struggles to understand a code method or concept, not only can he or she get assistance from a TA, but the 
     student can also interact with colleagues who have slightly more coding experience to figure out solutions. There's a sense of 
     camaraderie when I look to my left or right and notice someone encountering the same complication I'm having, because it shows 
     me that I'm not going through the challenges and frustrations associated with learning code alone, and if need be, there's a network 
     of knowledgable peers to reach out to for help. If you're reading this, that means I have successfully developed and published my first 
     webpage with the training offered by LaunchCode. This webpage is a testament that you don't need any prior experience in computer 
     programming to become a coder. If you have the will, there's a way.</p>
